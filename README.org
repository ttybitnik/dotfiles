This repository contains my personal collection of scripts and configuration files.

The description is structured around the custom environments I run, including a *FreeBSD* headless laptop (=tty= environment), a *Fedora* desktop with Sway (=wayland= environment), and a *Debian* desktop with Dwm (=xorg= environment). It is worth noting that the TTY tools are employed across all environments.

** Usage

Before using my dotfiles, change the personal environment values in =./tty/.bash_profile= accordingly.

*** Symbolic links

To automate the process of creating symbolic links from the repository files to their respective locations, use one of the following commands in the /dotfiles' root directory/ =.=:

#+begin_quote
ℹ️ The TTY environment is automatically installed when choosing any of the graphical environment options.
#+end_quote

**** TTY environment
#+begin_src shell
  make tty
#+end_src

**** Wayland environment
#+begin_src shell
  make wayland
#+end_src

**** Xorg environment
#+begin_src shell
  make xorg
#+end_src

*** Switcher

To switch between light and dark modes globally, just run =switcher=. This custom script sends SIGHUP signals to the respective programs, making it easy to adapt to changes in ambient light without having to manually adjust each program's settings.

*** Omni

To automate system updates, run =omni=. This script checks for the availability of various package managers and executes the corresponding update commands. It ensures that every manager present in the enviroment update its packages.

*** Hermes

To display a MOTD with a log of last logins and a custom fortune, run =hermes=. This script is designed to be executed automatically in every interactive login shell through =hermes.service= and =.bash_profile=. For more details, check the script comments.

*** Euterpe

To streamline the music experience, just run =euterpe=. This script leverages tmux to attach to a session with windows related to managing system sound and media.
