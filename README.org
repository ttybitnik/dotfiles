This repository contains my personal collection of scripts and configuration files, stored in the standard repository path =~/.config/dotfiles/=, with symbolic links pointing from =~=.

The description is structured around the custom environments I run, including a *FreeBSD* headless laptop (/TTY environment/), a *Fedora* desktop with Sway (/Wayland environment/), and a *Debian* desktop with Dwm (/Xorg environment/). It is worth noting that the TTY tools are employed across all environments.

- GNU Lynx
- GNU Midnight Commander
- Kmonad
- Systemd
- Wayland environment
  - Foot
  - Sway
  - Waybar

The configuration files are located in the following repository paths: =.=, =~/.config/=, =~/.local/share/=.

** Usage
*** Switcher

To switch between light and dark modes globally, just run =switcher=. This custom script sends SIGHUP signals to the respective programs, making it easy to adapt to changes in ambient light without having to manually adjust each program's settings.

*** Omni

To automate system updates, run =omni=. This script checks for the availability of various package managers and executes the corresponding update commands. It ensures that every manger present in the enviroment update its packages. 

*** Hermes

To display a MOTD with a log of last logins and a custom fortune, run =hermes=. This script is designed to be executed automatically in every interactive login shell through =hermes.service= and =.bash_profile=. For more details, check the script comments.

*** Euterpe

To streamline the music experience, just run =euterpe=. This script leverages tmux to attach to a session with windows related to managing system sound and media.

*** Automating symbolic links

To automate the process of creating symbolic links from the repository files to their respective locations, use the following script:

#+begin_src shell
  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  # Automate the creation of symlinks for the dotfiles.
  # This can overwrite previous config files.

  create_symlink() {
      local source
      local target
      source="${HOME}/.config/dotfiles/$1"
      target="${HOME}/$2"

      mkdir -p "$(dirname "$target")"
      ln -sf "$source" "$target"
      printf ">> %s\n" "$target"
  }

  tty_env() {
      printf "\nTTY environment"
      create_symlink ".local/bin" ".local/bin"
      create_symlink ".local/share/mc/skins" ".local/share/mc/skins"
      create_symlink ".config/lynx" ".config/lynx"
      create_symlink ".config/kmonad/config.kbd" ".config/kmonad/config.kbd"
      create_symlink ".config/tmux/tmux.conf" ".config/tmux/tmux.conf"
      create_symlink ".bash_aliases" ".bash_aliases"
      create_symlink ".bash_profile" ".bash_profile"
      create_symlink ".bashrc" ".bashrc"
      create_symlink ".inputrc" ".inputrc"
      create_symlink ".config/mc/ini" ".config/mc/ini"
      create_symlink ".config/systemd/user" ".config/systemd/user"
  }

  wayland_env() {
      printf "\nSway environment"
      create_symlink ".config/sway" ".config/sway"
      create_symlink ".config/waybar" ".config/waybar"
      create_symlink ".config/foot" ".config/foot"
      create_symlink ".config/rofi" ".config/rofi"
      create_symlink ".config/dunst/dunstrc-dark" ".config/dunst/dunstrc"
      create_symlink ".config/swaylock" ".config/swaylock"
  }

  xorg_env() {
      printf "\nDwm environment"
      create_symlink ".local/share/dwm" ".local/share/dwm"
      create_symlink ".config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc" ".config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc"
      create_symlink ".config/xsettingsd/xsettingsd-dark.conf" ".config/xsettingsd/xsettingsd.conf"
      create_symlink ".Xresources-dark" ".Xresources"
      create_symlink ".config/urxvt" ".urxvt"
  }

  printf "Choose an environment:\n"
  printf "1. Wayland - sway\n"
  printf "2. Xorg - dwm\n"
  printf "3. TTY only\n"
  read -p "Enter your choice (1, 2 or 3): " choice

  if [ "$choice" = "1" ]; then
      wayland_env
      tty_env
  elif [ "$choice" = "2" ]; then
      xorg_env
      tty_env
  elif [ "$choice" = "3" ]; then
      tty_env
  else
      printf "Invalid choice. Exiting.\n" >&2
      exit 1
  fi

  printf "\nAll symlinks created successfully!\n"
#+end_src

If you use *GNU Emacs*, you can execute the above code block with =C-c C-c=.

** Miscellaneous

This section contains additional fine-tuning configurations for the packages and projects that I use in conjunction with my dotfiles.

**** Ytfzf and yt-dlp

To improve the performance of ytfzf, I recommend creating a symbolic link from =/usr/local/bin/yt-dlp= to =/usr/bin/youtube-dl=. This makes *ytfzf* work through *yt-dlp* instead of the hard-coded *youtube-dl*. Additionally, make sure to install =ffmpeg= for the highest video quality.

**** GTK Emacs-like key bindings

To enable Emacs-style key bindings within the GTK-based applications, make the following changes to the =~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini= file:

#+begin_src conf
~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
[Settings]
gtk-key-theme-name = Emacs
#+end_src

**** TTY environment

**** Wayland environment

***** Gammastep

To adjust the color temperature of the display based on the time of day, edit the location command in the =autostart= script.

**** Xorg environment

***** Mouse speed

To adjust the mouse speed in Xorg, create the file =/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mouse-acceleration.conf= with the following content:

#+begin_src conf
Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "My Mouse"
	Driver "libinput"
	MatchIsPointer "yes"
	Option "AccelProfile" "flat"
	Option "AccelSpeed" "0"
EndSection
#+end_src

After saving the file, restart Xorg.

***** Redshift

To adjust the color temperature of the display based on the time of day, edit the location command in the =autostart= script.
