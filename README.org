This repository contains my personal collection of scripts and configuration files, stored in the standard repository path =~/.config/dotfiles/=, with symbolic links pointing from =~=.

The description is structured around the custom environments I run, including a *FreeBSD* headless laptop (/TTY environment/), a *Fedora* desktop with Sway (/Wayland environment/), and a *Debian* desktop with Dwm (/Xorg environment/). It is worth noting that the TTY tools are employed across all environments.

** Usage
*** Automating symbolic links

To automate the process of creating symbolic links from the repository files to their respective locations, use the following script:

#+begin_src shell
  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  CreateSymlink() {
      source="${HOME}/.config/dotfiles/$1"
      target="${HOME}/$2"

      mkdir -p "$(dirname "$target")"
      ln -sf "$source" "$target"
      echo ">> $target"
  }

  echo "Choose an environment:"
  echo "1. Wayland - sway"
  echo "2. Xorg - dwm"
  read -p "Enter your choice (1 or 2): " choice

  if [ "$choice" = "1" ]; then
      echo -e "\nSway environment"
      CreateSymlink ".config/sway" ".config/sway"
      CreateSymlink ".config/waybar" ".config/waybar"
      CreateSymlink ".config/foot" ".config/foot"
      CreateSymlink ".config/rofi" ".config/rofi"
      CreateSymlink ".config/dunst/dunstrc-dark" ".config/dunst/dunstrc"
      CreateSymlink ".config/swaylock" ".config/swaylock"
  elif [ "$choice" = "2" ]; then
      echo -e "\nDwm environment"
      CreateSymlink ".local/share/dwm" ".local/share/dwm"
      CreateSymlink ".config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc" ".config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc"
      CreateSymlink ".config/xsettingsd/xsettingsd-dark.conf" ".config/xsettingsd/xsettingsd.conf"
      CreateSymlink ".Xresources-dark" ".Xresources"
      CreateSymlink ".config/urxvt" ".urxvt"
  else
      echo "Invalid choice. Exiting."
      exit 1
  fi

  echo -e "\nTTY environment"
  CreateSymlink ".local/bin" ".local/bin"
  CreateSymlink ".local/share/mc/skins" ".local/share/mc/skins"
  CreateSymlink ".config/lynx" ".config/lynx"
  CreateSymlink ".config/kmonad/config.kbd" ".config/kmonad/config.kbd"
  CreateSymlink ".config/tmux/tmux.conf" ".config/tmux/tmux.conf"
  CreateSymlink ".bash_aliases" ".bash_aliases"
  CreateSymlink ".config/mc/ini" ".config/mc/ini"

  echo -e "\nAll symlinks created successfully!"
#+end_src

If you use *GNU Emacs*, you can execute the above code block with =C-c C-c=.

** Miscellaneous

This section contains additional fine-tuning configurations for the packages and projects that I use in conjunction with my dotfiles.

**** Ytfzf and yt-dlp

To improve the performance of ytfzf, I recommend creating a symbolic link from =/usr/local/bin/yt-dlp= to =/usr/bin/youtube-dl=. This makes *ytfzf* work through *yt-dlp* instead of the hard-coded *youtube-dl*. Additionally, make sure to install =ffmpeg= for the highest video quality.

**** Switcher

To switch between light and dark modes globally, just run =switcher=. This custom script from my [[https://github.com/w0lper/dotfiles][dotfiles]] sends SIGHUP signals to the respective programs, making it easy to adapt to changes in ambient light without having to manually adjust each program's settings.

**** GTK Emacs-like key bindings

To enable Emacs-style key bindings within the GTK-based applications, make the following changes to the =~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini= file:

#+begin_src conf
~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
[Settings]
gtk-key-theme-name = Emacs
#+end_src

**** TTY environment

**** Wayland environment

***** Gammastep

To adjust the color temperature of the display based on the time of day, edit the location command in the =autostart= script.

**** Xorg environment

***** Mouse speed

To adjust the mouse speed in Xorg, create the file =/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mouse-acceleration.conf= with the following content:

#+begin_src conf
Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "My Mouse"
	Driver "libinput"
	MatchIsPointer "yes"
	Option "AccelProfile" "flat"
	Option "AccelSpeed" "0"
EndSection
#+end_src

After saving the file, restart Xorg.

***** Redshift

To adjust the color temperature of the display based on the time of day, edit the location command in the =autostart= script.
