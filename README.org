** Usage
*** Automating symbolic links

To automate the process of creating symbolic links from the repository files to their respective locations, use the following script:

#+begin_src shell
  #!/bin/bash

  mkdir -p ~/.local/ &
  mkdir -p ~/.local/share/ & 
  mkdir -p ~/.config/tmux/ &
  mkdir -p ~/.config/sxhkd/ &
  mkdir -p ~/.config/kmonad/ &

  sleep 3

  ln -sf ~/.config/dotfiles/.local/bin/ ~/.local/bin &
  ln -sf ~/.config/dotfiles/.local/share/dwm/ ~/.local/share/dwm &
  ln -sf ~/.config/dotfiles/.config/tmux/tmux.conf ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf &
  ln -sf ~/.config/dotfiles/.config/kmonad/config.kbd ~/.config/kmonad/config.kbd &
  ln -sf ~/.config/dotfiles/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc &
  ln -sf ~/.config/dotfiles/.Xresources ~/.Xresources &
  ln -sf ~/.config/dotfiles/.bash_aliases ~/.bash_aliases &
  ln -sf ~/.config/dotfiles/.config/urxvt/ ~/.urxvt &
#+end_src
