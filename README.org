This repository contains my personal collection of scripts and configuration files with symbolic links pointing from =~=.

The description is structured around the custom environments I run, including a *FreeBSD* headless laptop (=tty= environment), a *Fedora* desktop with Sway (=wayland= environment), and a *Debian* desktop with Dwm (=xorg= environment). It is worth noting that the TTY tools are employed across all environments.

** Configurations

This repository includes configuration files for the following applications:

- TTY environment
  - Bash
  - Readline
  - Git
  - Tmux
  - Curl
  - GNU Lynx
  - GNU Midnight Commander
  - Kmonad
  - Systemd
- Wayland environment
  - Foot
  - Sway
  - Waybar
  - Swaylock
  - Rofi
  - Dunst
- Xorg environment
  - Urxvt
  - Sxhkd
  - Xresources
  - Xsettingsd

The configuration files are located in the following repository paths: =./{environment}/.config/=, =./{environment}/.local/share/=.

** Usage
*** Symbolic links

To automate the process of creating symbolic links from the repository files to their respective locations, use one of the following commands in the /dotfiles' root directory/ =.=:

#+begin_quote
ℹ️ The TTY environment is automatically installed when choosing any of the graphical environment options.
#+end_quote

**** TTY environment
#+begin_src shell
  make tty
#+end_src

**** Wayland environment
#+begin_src shell
  make wayland
#+end_src

**** Xorg environment
#+begin_src shell
  make xorg
#+end_src

*** Switcher

To switch between light and dark modes globally, just run =switcher=. This custom script sends SIGHUP signals to the respective programs, making it easy to adapt to changes in ambient light without having to manually adjust each program's settings.

*** Omni

To automate system updates, run =omni=. This script checks for the availability of various package managers and executes the corresponding update commands. It ensures that every manager present in the enviroment update its packages.

*** Hermes

To display a MOTD with a log of last logins and a custom fortune, run =hermes=. This script is designed to be executed automatically in every interactive login shell through =hermes.service= and =.bash_profile=. For more details, check the script comments.

*** Euterpe

To streamline the music experience, just run =euterpe=. This script leverages tmux to attach to a session with windows related to managing system sound and media.

** Miscellaneous

This section contains additional fine-tuning configurations for the packages and projects that I use in conjunction with my dotfiles.

**** Ytfzf and yt-dlp

To improve the performance of ytfzf, I recommend creating a symbolic link from =/usr/local/bin/yt-dlp= to =/usr/bin/youtube-dl=. This makes *ytfzf* work through *yt-dlp* instead of the hard-coded *youtube-dl*. Additionally, make sure to install =ffmpeg= for the highest video quality.

**** GTK Emacs-like key bindings

To enable Emacs-style key bindings within the GTK-based applications, make the following changes to the =~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini= file:

#+begin_src conf
~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
[Settings]
gtk-key-theme-name = Emacs
#+end_src

**** TTY environment

**** Wayland environment

**** Xorg environment

***** Mouse speed

To adjust the mouse speed in Xorg, create the file =/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mouse-acceleration.conf= with the following content:

#+begin_src conf
Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "My Mouse"
	Driver "libinput"
	MatchIsPointer "yes"
	Option "AccelProfile" "flat"
	Option "AccelSpeed" "0"
EndSection
#+end_src

After saving the file, restart Xorg.
